# Linux_Task1
### Understand the file permissions and create a flowchart for it. Then, apply the chmod command in a Python file to make the permissions rwxrwxr-x.

in this task, I understood the Linux file permissions.
### In Linux systems, file permissions are broken into three groups:
Owner: The owner of the file.
Group: Users in the file's group.
Others: All other users.

### Each group has three permissions:
Read: View file contents (value: 4).
Write: Modify file contents (value: 2).
Execute: Run the file as a program (value: 1).

### rwxrwxr-x means:
Owner: rwx (read, write, execute).
Group: rwx (read, write, execute).
Others: r-x (read, execute).
In octal notation (775).
